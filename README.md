Plushi is a language agnostic push interpreter capable of running push programs
via JSON/EDN interface.

Push is a programming language designed for AI systems to write software in.
It has virtually no syntax and supports all common data types and can express
a variety of control structures and data structures.

To read more about the push language, see the [Push Redux](https://erp12.github.io/push-redux/).


## Installation

Download from https://github.com/erp12/plushi/releases.

For easy integration with Clojure projects, a public clojars release coming soon!


## Usage

### Standalone

Currently, plushi is a tool that is meant to be used as a standalone jar, however
it is expected that this will most commonly be done via system calls from inside
other programs.

$ java -jar plushi-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

Send complex data structures to plushi from another context, serialized data
sturctures such as JSON and EDN are used. For more information on how to used
the plushi standalone with various arguments, see the Options section of the
README and the introduction documentation topic.


### Clojure

Plushi can also be used as a Clojure library for easy integration with Clojure
projects. For more information see with documentation on this topic.

### Python

A python interface using Py4j might be in this project's future, but it is not
currently being worked on. In the meantime, you can run plushi from Python
using the standalone jar and system calls.

If you would like to help integrate plushi and python (or any other language)
consider contributing!


## Options

### --instruction-set, -I

Returns a serialized object desciribing the instructions which are supported by the interpreter. The serialized list will be encoded using the format specified by `--format`.

The returned serialized object includes instruction names, the types of values they accept as input, and the types of values they produce as output. Users can create program by assembling serialzied programs out of the instructions which are relavent to their system.

To include instructions which processs inputs, the `--arity` argument must be specified.

### --supported-types, -T

Returns a serialized list of push types which are supported by the interpreter. The serialized list will be encoded using the format specified by `--format`.

### --run, -R

Must be followed by a serialized program. Returns the result of running the program. Result will be returned in the format specified by `--format`.

Requires the `--inputs` argument also be specified.

### --dataset, -D

Must be followed by a serialized dataset of inputs to the push program. Serialization should be in the format specified by `--format`.

### --format, -f

Denotes the file format to use for communication. Supported formats are given in
the below table

| Format | Link                              | Status         |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| json   | https://www.json.org/             | Supported      |
| edn    | https://github.com/edn-format/edn | In Development |

### --arity, -a

Must be followed by a non-negative integer denoting the number of input values that is required to run the program.
